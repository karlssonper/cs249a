SHIPMENT INJECTION
The Customer location type has been equipped with a set of extra attributes compared to those in assignment 2, as well a notifiee class. The notifiees responds to changes in the 'shipment size', 'transfer rate' and 'destination' attributes. When all three are set, the notifiee (CustomerReactor) creates activities that when executed injects shipments into the network at the rate (via the InjectActivityReactor class that is a notifiee to the activites).

SHIPMENT FORWARDING 

CAPACITY

																		  
REAL TIME ACTIVITY MANAGER
Activities are added to the virtual time manager, and corresponding activities are at the same time added to the real time activity manager. In the real time activity manager, the executing points are scaled with a factor. For example, a factor of 0.1 makes one hour in the virtual time manager run in a tenth of the time. With each activity executing, the real time activity manager sets nowIs() for the virtual time manager and sleeps the proper amount of time between calls. The user sets the time scale factor through the TimeManager instance in the client layer:

    Ptr<Instance> timeManager = manager->instanceNew("myTimeManager", "Time manager");
    timeManager->attributeIs("time scale", "0.0001");
		
The time scale needs to be set at the beginning of the client program, so that following activites gets the initial time scaling right. When the network has been set up, the user starts the simulation and specifies the simulation end in virtual hours by setting the simulationEnd attribute:
	
	timeManager->attributeIs("simulation end", "100"); 
	
																		  
ROUTING ALGORITHMS

EXCEPTION BASED ERROR HANDLING
Our exception based error handling is based on the Fwk::Exception class, which have a set of derived exception types. When an error occurs anywhere in the engine or rep layer, the active function prints a meaningful error message to cerr with some information of what state the function had when the error occured. Then the function throws the proper type of exception. The exceptions are not caught until the client code (or in the case of exceptions in reactors, they are caught in the BaseNotifiee object which prints an error message and exits the application). 
Instansiating functions and mutators can throw exceptions when new() allocations fails, or when entities are not found. We've chosen to throw exceptions for when entities are not found (rather then just ignoring the call and continuing) because a missing entity could corrupt a network and make it hard to track down. Therefore, it is better to throw an exception and let the user handle the error. The same argument holds for throwing a TypeMismatch exception when, for example, trying to connect a boat segment to a truck terminal or querying a port for shipments recieved.
We have chosen to let deleting instances just continue (not throw exceptions) even if the entities to be deleted are not found, because the end result is the same (the entity does not exist anymore). In this case, the application can run as usual.


SCHEDULING FLEET UPDATES
To enable the fleet's stats to be updated at certain times, we have implemented a solution where the fleet instance keeps track of two different sets of data (for example, one for daytime and one for nighttime). The user specifies the alternate set of data by using "costAlt" instead of "cost" as fleet attributes. The time interval when this alternate set of data becomes active is specified via the "alt time" attribute, and the input should be formatted as a string with two integers. For example, fleet->attributeIs("alt time", "10 22") would make the simulation switch to the alternate data set at time 10, and then switch back at 22. Then the switches occurs with 24 hour intervals for as long as the simulation runs. The network queries the fleet object at different points in time and will always get the active set of data through the usual accessors.
